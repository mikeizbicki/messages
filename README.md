# Messages

The purpose of this repository is to let you experiment with github's built-in messaging features.

**Instructions:**

1. Introduce yourself to at least 2 other people in class.
    Try to meet someone new and not live up to the programmer stereotypes:

    <img src=meme.jpg width=400px />

    (This class will seriously be a lot easier and more fun if you're working with other people on the projects... and you can't work with people you've never met...)

1. For each person you met above:

    1. Create a new github issue in this repository (not the class repo).

       The title of the message should say something like `Hello $NAME` where `$NAME` is the name of the person.
        The body of the message should say something like `you rock @$ACCOUNT`,
        where `$ACCOUNT` is the person's github user account.

        Here's an example:

        <img src=screenshot.png />

    1. Whenever a github account is @mentioned in an issue body,
        the account owner will receive an email.
        You should verify that the email went through.

1. Continue working on the remainder of the lab.
    I encourage you to work with the people you just met.
